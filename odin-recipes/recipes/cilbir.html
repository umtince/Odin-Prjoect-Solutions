        <ol>
            <li>Bring a saucepan of water with a splash of vinegar to the boil.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, mix your yoghurt with the garlic, mint, paprika and salt and divide between two plates.</li>
            <li>Swirl a spoon in the centre of the yoghurt to spread it out and leave a well in the centre.</li>
            <li>Crack your eggs one at a time onto a small plate, taking care not to break the yolk.</li>
            <li>Stir your boiling water with a whisk so that it starts to swirl.</li>
            <li>Whilst the water is swirling, carefully pour one egg into the centre of the swirl and poach for 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the egg with a slotted spoon and place into the iced water. repeat the process for the remaining three eggs.</li>
            <li>Leave the boiling water on the heat.</li>
            <li>If you are having your çılbır with toasted bread, start to toast it now.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, gently heat your butter and chilli flakes over a low heat and stir until the chilli has infused and the butter is starting to bubble. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Now place all four poached eggs back into the simmering water for 30 seconds to reheat. The eggs can all go into the water together.</li>
            <li>Remove each one carefully with a slotted spoon and drain before placing two eggs into the centre of each yoghurt well on your plates.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the melted chill butter over the poached eggs and yoghurt and serve immediately with your hot, toasted bread.</li>
        </ol>
